This repo is a SwiftUI iOS application using the Combine framework and MVVM architecture, that interacts with the New York Times API (https://api.nytimes.com/) to display news articles. The app consists of three main screens.

This repo follows the principles of clean architecture, utilizing separate layers for presentation, domain, and data. It also incorporates best practices for SwiftUI and Combine, including reactive programming and asynchronous data handling.

In this application, we apply [Clean Architecture for SwiftUI](https://nalexn.github.io/clean-architecture-swiftui/?utm_source=nalexn_github)
